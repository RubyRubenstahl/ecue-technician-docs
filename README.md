This repository contains a collection of documents that are useful in the commissioning e:cue lighting systems. At the moment, the collection only contains a few documents, but I expect it to grow over time. 

## Glass Touch Layouts
This series of documents is intended to make the documenting of Glass Touch button Layouts easy, clean, and consistent. 

The forms are in PDF format and all text areas, including the title, are editable as form elements so that they can be easily edited with nearly any PDF viewer. 

## Butler XT2 SD Card Replacement Instructions
This form is intended as a simple guide for end-users who need to replace the MicroSD card in the Butler XT2. I mainly use this when I need to ship out a card with minor updated to a show where a site visit is not required.
